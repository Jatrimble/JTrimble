        <h1>Welcome to Jelani Trimble's Design Practice</h1>
        <p>At the heart of design is the relationship between people and the spaces they inhabit. My practice explores the intricate connections between scale, geography, culture, and emotion, striving to create environments that not only serve functional needs but also foster well-being. I focus on how aesthetics, space, and light shape our mental and physical health, with a commitment to sustainable and human-centered design.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Ideals and Philosophy</h2>
        <h3>Design for Human Connection</h3>
        <p>My design philosophy is rooted in the belief that spaces profoundly influence our emotions, behavior, and overall well-being. Whether it's the calming effects of natural light or the way scale can evoke a sense of security, each decision is intentional. Every element—from layout to materials—fosters a deep sense of connection between people and their environment.</p>
        
        <h4>Aesthetics and Physicality</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “A house that has been experienced is not an inert box. Inhabited space transcends geometrical space.”</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> This captures how aesthetics and physicality shape our emotional responses. Spaces are not just physical; they evoke deep psychological experiences that resonate with our sense of well-being and connection to the environment.</p>

        <h4>Scale and Proportion</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism by Rudolf Wittkower</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "The harmony of proportion is not a matter of aesthetics alone but of emotional and intellectual satisfaction.”</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Scale and proportion are essential in creating spaces that feel harmonious. Properly scaled environments make us feel balanced and emotionally secure, demonstrating that good design connects both the mind and body.</p>

        <h4>Geography and Culture</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> The Geography of Thought by Richard E. Nisbett</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Culture and geography shape not just what we think but how we think."</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> The spatial and cultural elements in design help ground people in their environments. By reflecting local geography and culture, spaces can better support the cognitive and emotional needs of those who use them.</p>

        <h4>Emotion and Well-Being</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things by Donald A. Norman</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “Attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively.”</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Design impacts how we feel. Thoughtfully curated aesthetics influence emotional well-being, creating environments that can inspire creativity, productivity, and a sense of peace.</p>

        <h2>2. Design in Practice</h2>
        <h3>Merging Aesthetics with Function</h3>
        <p>The spaces I create are more than just beautiful; they are designed to enhance human life. From creating environments that promote productivity and creativity to those that offer serenity and reflection, my practice is dedicated to transforming spaces into experiences. Design must not only meet aesthetic ideals but also elevate the daily lives of those who interact with it.</p>
        
        <h4>Use and Functionality</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change by Victor Papanek</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Design must be an innovative, highly creative, cross-disciplinary tool responsive to the true needs of people."</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Functionality is at the core of human-centered design. Beyond aesthetics, a space must fulfill the practical needs of its inhabitants while fostering an environment of well-being and comfort.</p>

        <h4>Climate and Geography</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> Design with Climate: Bioclimatic Approach to Architectural Regionalism by Victor Olgyay</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Good design is regionally appropriate, working with the climate rather than against it."</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Understanding how geography and climate influence a design leads to spaces that are sustainable and comfortable. A bioclimatic approach aligns the built environment with the natural world, improving both ecological sustainability and human health.</p>

        <h4>Cultural Sensitivity</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> Place and Placelessness by Edward Relph</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "To be human is to live in a world that is filled with significant places: to be human is to have and to know your place."</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Culturally sensitive design honors the significance of place, ensuring that spaces reflect the identities, traditions, and needs of the communities they serve. This fosters stronger emotional connections and a sense of belonging.</p>

        <h2>3. Impact on Well-Being</h2>
        <h3>Design as a Catalyst for Health</h3>
        <p>Thoughtful design enhances how we feel and live within a space. Research has shown that natural light, spatial arrangement, and material choices can have profound effects on both mental and physical well-being. By integrating principles of wellness into design, I aim to create environments that support healthier, happier lifestyles.</p>
        
        <h4>Design for Health</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> The Poetics of Space by Gaston Bachelard</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "We are never real historians, but always near poets, and our emotion is perhaps nothing but an expression of a poetry that was lost."</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> The beauty of natural light and open spaces is poetic, enhancing both physical and emotional experiences within a space.</p>

        <h4>Color and Texture</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> Emotional Design by Donald Norman</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "We unconsciously assign emotions to everything we experience."</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> The emotional impact of color and texture is key in creating environments that support mental health. Warm tones and soft textures create comfort, while vibrant colors inspire energy.</p>

        <h4>Movement and Comfort</h4>
        <p><strong>Book:</strong> Design for the Real World by Victor Papanek</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "The only important thing about design is how it relates to people."</p>
        <p><strong>Connection:</strong> Spaces that encourage movement and comfort can improve physical health. A well-designed environment allows for ease of use, accessibility, and encourages daily physical activity.</p>

        <h2>4. Projects as Case Studies</h2>
        <h3>Applying Ideals in Real-World Projects</h3>
        <p>While my design ideals guide every project, each space I create serves as a case study in human connection and well-being. My projects are diverse, but all share the same core values: aesthetics serve functionality, and design must foster an emotional connection between the space and the people who inhabit it.</p>
